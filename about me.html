    <h2 style="font-size:25px;"> Background: </h2>
    <h3 style="text-align:center;font-size:20px;"> I go to McNair Academic High School in Jersey City, New Jersey. I am
        14 years old and a rising sophomore.</h3>
    <h4 style="font-size:25px"> Extracurriculars & Hobbies: </h4>
    <h5 style="text-align:center;font-size:20px;"> Some of my hobbies are cross-country, softball, and playing the piano
        and flute. I participate in many clubs as well, such as model UN, Science Research, Epsilon Math Club, Business
        and Entrepreneurship Club, and even write for my school newspaper. To broaden my coding exposure, I am currently
        coding an Android App and taking computer programming courses online. My passion is in STEM, and I someday wish
        to pursue a career in that field. I want to become a computer engineer. </h5>
    <h6 style="font-size: 25px;">Why I Found Life Below Water:</h6>
    <h6 style="text-align:center;font-size:20px;">Ocean pollution has always been of an interest to me ever since I was a little girl. Whenever I saw plastic on the beach or washed up on the shore, I would go to throw it out. I have
        read numerous articles and done research on the topic of ocean pollution, and realized that I can make a change in my community, and I did it by starting Life Below Water, a nonprofit dedicated to reducing ocean pollution and educating others of its dangers.
        As plastic production is increasing in our economy today, the problem of its effect on the oceans is terrible. By finding Life Below Water,
        I hope to empower others in my community to realize the dangers of ocean pollution and help to reduce it.
